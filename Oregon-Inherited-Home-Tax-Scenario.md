# Oregon Inherited Home Tax Scenario: Rent, Then Sell Without Moving Back In

## Scenario Overview

- **Inherited Home Value (Step-Up Basis):** $179,000 (as of 12 years ago)
- **You own the home free and clear, no mortgage**
- **You decide to rent the house for 8 years**
- **You then sell the house after 8 years, never having moved back in**

## Hypothetical Sale

- **Sale Price After 8 Years:** $400,000

## Capital Gains Calculation

1. **Cost Basis (Inherited Value):** $179,000
2. **Depreciation Taken (while rented):**
   - Depreciation is typically calculated over 27.5 years for residential property.
   - Annual depreciation = $179,000 ÷ 27.5 ≈ $6,509 per year
   - 8 years of depreciation = $6,509 × 8 ≈ $52,072

3. **Adjusted Cost Basis:**
   - $179,000 (original basis) - $52,072 (depreciation) = $126,928

4. **Capital Gain:**
   - Sale Price ($400,000) - Adjusted Basis ($126,928) = **$273,072**

5. **Depreciation Recapture:**
   - The $52,072 depreciation taken is **taxed separately** as "depreciation recapture" (taxed at a maximum federal rate of 25%).

6. **Non-Qualification for Exclusion:**
   - Since you did **not live in the home for 2 out of the last 5 years**, you **cannot exclude** up to $250,000/$500,000 of gain under the IRS rules.

## Example Tax Calculation Table

| Item                        | Amount           |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Sale Price                  | $400,000         |
| Original Cost Basis         | $179,000         |
| Depreciation (8 years)      | $52,072          |
| Adjusted Cost Basis         | $126,928         |
| Capital Gain                | $273,072         |
| Depreciation Recapture      | $52,072          |
| Exclusion Available?        | No               |

## Key Points Summary

- **You must pay capital gains tax** on the difference between sale price and adjusted basis.
- **Depreciation recapture is taxed separately** at a maximum 25% federal rate.
- **No capital gains exclusion** applies unless you lived in the home for 2 of the last 5 years prior to sale.
- **Oregon also taxes capital gains**, so state tax is also due.
